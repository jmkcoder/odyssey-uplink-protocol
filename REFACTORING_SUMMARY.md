# Uplink Protocol Refactoring Complete

## Summary

We have successfully refactored the Uplink Protocol library to follow a multi-package architecture:

1. **Core Package (`@uplink-protocol/core`)**:
   - Contains only framework-agnostic functionality
   - Always uses the vanilla adapter
   - Includes no framework-specific code in exports or compiled output

2. **Framework Packages (to be created)**:
   - `@uplink-protocol/react`
   - `@uplink-protocol/vue`
   - `@uplink-protocol/angular`
   - `@uplink-protocol/svelte`

## Completed Work

1. **Package Structure Changes**:
   - Renamed package to `@uplink-protocol/core`
   - Removed framework-specific exports
   - Simplified to UMD-only format
   - Updated documentation

2. **Code Changes**:
   - Removed framework-specific adapters from exports
   - Updated integration services to be framework-agnostic
   - Modified `detectFramework()` to always return 'vanilla'
   - Simplified `AdapterRegistry` to always use vanilla adapter

3. **Build Process Updates**:
   - Removed ESM and CJS build commands
   - Updated webpack configuration

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive guides for the multi-package approach
   - Added detailed instructions for creating framework packages
   - Updated existing documentation to reflect changes

## Next Steps

1. **Create Framework Packages**:
   - Follow the instructions in `docs/CREATING_FRAMEWORK_PACKAGES.md`
   - Copy relevant adapter and integration code to each package
   - Implement framework-specific hooks and bindings

2. **Publish Packages**:
   - Publish core package: `npm run create-package`
   - Build and publish framework packages

3. **Update Examples**:
   - Update example files to use the new package structure
   - Add dedicated examples for each framework

## Verification

All compiled code has been verified to contain no references to React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte. The core package now provides a clean, framework-agnostic foundation upon which the framework-specific packages can be built.

The multi-package architecture provides several benefits:
- Reduced bundle size
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Independent versioning
- Easier maintenance

## Final Note

This refactoring is a significant step toward making the Uplink Protocol more modular, maintainable, and user-friendly for developers working with different frameworks.
