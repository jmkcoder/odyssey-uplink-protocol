# Core Package Refactoring Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Package Structure
- Changed package name from `@jmkcoder/uplink-protocol` to `@uplink-protocol/core`
- Removed framework-specific exports from package.json
- Simplified to UMD-only format (removed ESM and CJS builds)
- Added documentation for the multi-package approach

### 2. Code Structure
- Removed framework-specific adapters from `src/services/adapter/index.ts`
- Updated `src/services/integration/index.ts` to remove framework-specific integrations
- Modified `detectFramework()` to always return 'vanilla'
- Simplified `AdapterRegistry` to always use vanilla adapter
- Removed `autoDetectEnabled` property from AdapterRegistry
- Retained `setAutoDetect()` as a no-op placeholder for framework packages

### 3. Build Process
- Removed ESM and CJS build commands
- Updated webpack configuration for UMD build
- Added script for framework package creation

### 4. Documentation
- Created PACKAGE_STRUCTURE.md explaining the multi-package approach
- Created CREATING_FRAMEWORK_PACKAGES.md with instructions
- Added framework package plan in FRAMEWORK_PACKAGES_PLAN.md
- Updated README.md with new package structure information

## Remaining Framework-specific Files

The following files still exist in the codebase but are no longer exported or used:

```
src/services/adapter/
  - angular-adapter.ts
  - react-adapter.ts
  - svelte-adapter.ts
  - vue-adapter.ts

src/services/integration/
  - angular.ts
  - react.tsx
  - svelte.ts
  - vue.ts
```

These files will serve as reference for creating the framework-specific packages.

## Next Steps

1. Create the separate framework packages:
   - @uplink-protocol/react
   - @uplink-protocol/vue
   - @uplink-protocol/angular
   - @uplink-protocol/svelte

2. Copy the relevant adapter and integration code to each package

3. Publish all packages to npm:
   ```bash
   # Core package
   npm run create-package
   
   # Framework packages (after creation)
   cd packages/[framework]
   npm publish --access=public
   ```

## Results

The refactored core package now contains only framework-agnostic functionality. All compiled code has been verified to contain no references to React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte. Framework-specific functionality will be moved to separate packages that depend on this core package.

Following the multi-package architecture will:
1. Reduce bundle size for applications that only need specific framework integrations
2. Provide cleaner separation of concerns
3. Allow for independent versioning of framework integrations
4. Make maintenance and future upgrades easier
