# Odyssey Uplink Protocol Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
The Odyssey Uplink Protocol is a framework-agnostic library for creating reactive user interfaces with a focus on simplicity and flexibility. This implementation enhances the build process and feature set to provide a comprehensive solution for developers.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Build Process Improvements
- Created separate builds for different module formats:
  - UMD bundle (dist/index.js)
  - CommonJS modules (dist/cjs/)
  - ES Modules (dist/esm/)
- Fixed TypeScript configuration issues
- Updated package.json with proper exports field

### 2. Method Parameters Support
- Added support for calling methods with parameters
- Fixed context handling in vanilla JavaScript controllers
- Implemented proper documentation and examples

### 3. Two-Way Binding
- Implemented a complete two-way binding solution:
  - Controller → UI binding through `watchProperty`
  - UI → Controller binding through event handlers and `updateProperty`
- Created browser demo showcasing the feature
- Added comprehensive documentation

### 4. Framework Adapters
- Implemented adapters for major frontend frameworks:
  - React adapter for seamless integration with React components
  - Vue adapter for Vue.js applications with reactive system integration
  - Angular adapter with change detection integration and component property binding
  - Svelte adapter with store-based reactivity and action integration
- Enhanced the VanillaJS adapter with comprehensive features:
  - `UplinkContainer` class for connecting controllers to DOM elements
  - `useUplink` function providing a React-like API for vanilla JS
  - `defineControllerElement` function for creating custom Web Components
- Replaced auto-detect with direct vanilla adapter initialization
- Created comprehensive documentation for each adapter with usage examples
- Implemented unit tests for all adapters to ensure compatibility and stability

### 5. Framework Integration Hooks
- Implemented framework-specific hooks for controller integration:
  - React: `useUplink` hook for React components with Container component
  - Vue: `useUplink` composable for Vue.js components with Container component
  - Angular: `useController` function and `ControllerService` for Angular components
  - Svelte: `getController` store integration and `connectElement` action for Svelte components
  - Vanilla JS: Enhanced `useUplink` function with React-like API
- Created a dedicated vanilla JS integration module with comprehensive features
- Added comprehensive examples in the documentation with practical use cases
- Implemented proper TypeScript declarations for improved developer experience
- Added integration tests for hook logic

## Documentation
- Updated README.md with latest features and framework-specific examples
- Enhanced QUICK_START.md with practical examples for all supported frameworks
- Added comprehensive two-way binding documentation in ZERO_CONFIG_USAGE.md
- Created FRAMEWORK_ADAPTERS.md with detailed descriptions of adapter architecture
- Created FRAMEWORK_HOOKS.md with framework-specific integration examples
- Added interactive examples in the examples directory:
  - framework-adapters-demo.html with interactive code samples
  - framework-hooks-demo.html with practical usage examples
- Created PowerShell scripts to easily launch demos
- Created dedicated TWO_WAY_BINDING.md for detailed implementation notes

## Testing
- Created browser demo showcasing all features
- Added a test script for validating two-way binding
- Updated package.json with test scripts
