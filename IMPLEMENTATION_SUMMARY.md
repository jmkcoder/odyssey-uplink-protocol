# Odyssey Uplink Protocol Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
The Odyssey Uplink Protocol is a framework-agnostic library for creating reactive user interfaces with a focus on simplicity and flexibility. This implementation enhances the build process and feature set to provide a comprehensive solution for developers.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Build Process Improvements
- Created separate builds for different module formats:
  - UMD bundle (dist/index.js)
  - CommonJS modules (dist/cjs/)
  - ES Modules (dist/esm/)
- Fixed TypeScript configuration issues
- Updated package.json with proper exports field

### 2. Method Parameters Support
- Added support for calling methods with parameters
- Fixed context handling in vanilla JavaScript controllers
- Implemented proper documentation and examples

### 3. Two-Way Binding
- Implemented a complete two-way binding solution:
  - Controller → UI binding through `watchProperty`
  - UI → Controller binding through event handlers and `updateProperty`
- Created browser demo showcasing the feature
- Added comprehensive documentation

### 4. Framework Adapters
- Implemented adapters for major frontend frameworks:
  - React adapter for seamless integration with React components
  - Vue adapter for Vue.js applications
  - Angular adapter with change detection integration
  - Svelte adapter with store-based reactivity
- Enhanced the existing VanillaJS adapter
- Added automatic framework detection
- Created documentation for each adapter with usage examples

## Documentation
- Updated README.md with latest features
- Enhanced QUICK_START.md with practical examples
- Added comprehensive two-way binding documentation in ZERO_CONFIG_USAGE.md
- Created dedicated TWO_WAY_BINDING.md for detailed implementation notes

## Testing
- Created browser demo showcasing all features
- Added a test script for validating two-way binding
- Updated package.json with test scripts
